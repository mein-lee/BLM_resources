Project Name: How to actively fight against racism

My project is a webpage with helpful online and offline resources, links, and information on the Black Lives Matter movement, along with 
other information on combating racial discrimination, police brutality, and injustice.

## Overview
There are four html pages in this project, each with their respective stylesheet files.
SCSS variables, nesting features and inheritance features were utilized in these files.
In every html page, there are:
- Images with specific dimensions, 
- Table of contents
- Hyperlinks (in the form of customized buttons) to the three other html pages, 
- One hyperlink placed at the bottom of the page to return to the top of the page.

## Index
Below are the detailed components of this project, along with their corresponding HTML page

1. Index.html :
- An alert message (Bootstrap component), 
- 12 images that utilizes Bootstrap's grid model for layout purposes,
- A mobile-responsive @media query that changes the background color for smaller screens.
- One of the divs of this page contains ~400 names of police brutality victims.
